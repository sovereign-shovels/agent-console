## Identity

This repo is **agent-console** — part of the [sovereign-shovels](../README.md) portfolio.

- **Substrate anchor:** Cross-cut: Cline + Aider + Claude Code + Goose + OpenHands users
- **Utility category:** console
- **Tagline:** Unified log timeline for your agent sessions. Replay, search, compare across Cline, Aider, Claude Code, Goose.
- **Sprint:** 4
- **Estimated build for v0.1:** 3–4 weeks for v0.1

The substrate this shovel rides is: Anyone running multiple agentic coding tools and losing track of what each did

The launch channels are: r/cursor, r/ClineProject, r/aider, AI Twitter, HN

## Philosophy this repo lives by

Read the universal philosophy: [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]].

In short, every shovel must satisfy all five rules:

1. **Substrate-anchored name** ✓ (this is `agent-console`)
2. **Sovereign by construction** — user owns model choice, BYO endpoint, must work with local-only
3. **Real demand evidence** — gap is documented, not assumed
4. **Buildable in 1–3 weeks** — v0.1 estimate is 3–4 weeks for v0.1
5. **Scope-evolution headroom** — see PRD-v1 for v0.1 → v0.5 → v1.0

## STRICT NO-NOS — do not violate any of these

### Universal (inherited from [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]])

1. NO hardcoded API keys, vendor URLs, or model names in code outside config files.
2. NO default that requires a sign-up upstream. Tool must work with a local model.
3. NO telemetry, phone-home, or analytics by default.
4. NO closed-source runtime dependencies that compromise sovereignty.
5. NO scope creep into "agent platform" or "general assistant" territory.
6. NO fake claims of being official upstream tooling.
7. NO breaking config changes in v0.x without printed migration path.
8. NO maintenance promises in README. "Best-effort community shovel."
9. NO PRs merged without working tests.
10. NO publishing v1.0 without PRD-v1 acceptance criteria met.

### Specific to agent-console

1. Never modify logs of source tools — read-only access always.
2. Never upload logs anywhere by default. Replay is local.
3. Log format adapters are best-effort; document gracefully when a format changes.

### Anti-scope (what NOT to build, ever, in this repo)

Not a tool launcher. Not a project manager. Not a billing dashboard. Just observability.

## How to operate here

When you (the agent) start work in this repo:

1. **Read** [[PRD-v1]] before writing any code.
2. **Read** [[../PHILOSOPHY|Philosophy]] and [[../NO-NOS|NO-NOS]] if you haven't this session.
3. **Update** [[progress]] after each significant change. Update the YAML
   frontmatter — the root [[../PORTFOLIO]] view aggregates from it.
4. **If a decision conflicts with this AGENTS.md**, STOP and ask the human.
5. **If a user asks for something that violates a no-no**, push back. Don't comply.
6. **Commits** follow conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.).
7. **Branches**: `main` is protected. Work on `feat/<thing>` branches and PR.
8. **Tests** are required for any code path that ships in v0.1.

## Tombstone watch

What could kill this shovel:

Any one tool building proper internal observability. Medium — Aider has logs, Cline could. But cross-tool unification is the moat.

What we're watching for:

All major agent tools standardizing on the same log format independently. Then this becomes a thin viewer.

If the kill signal triggers, notify the human before taking further action.
